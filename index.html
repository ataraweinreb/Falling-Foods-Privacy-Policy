  <h1>Falling Foods Privacy Policy</h1><br>
  <h5> Falling Foods uses the device's TrueDepth camera system to track the movement of your mouth. This allows for a unique user experience â€” a game you can play with your face. In order for this functionality to be possible, the app requires access to your device's camera. This access can be toggled on or off at any time in your device's settings. <br><br>

The camera images and resulting depth data are only used for gameplay purposes.The live video feed is never used, and its data is never stored locally or remotely. Camera access is required to get depth data from Apple's API's. The only depth data collected is related to the movement of your mouth: whether your mouth is in an "open", "closed" or "tongue-out" position. <br><br>

This data is stored on the device only for the duration of your current game session. Every time the home screen is presented or the app is closed, the data is deleted. This data is used to make your gameplay experience more enjoyable and allow the character's mouth to mimic your own and simulate catching foods on the screen. <br><br>

Face data is never stored remotely, given to third parties, or used for any non-gameplay purposes. The face data only remains on your device, and never leaves your device at any time. <br><br>

Additionally, the game can optionally record your screenplay with your permission and save it to the camera roll or share it via social media, email, and airdrop on select devices. <br><br>

If you have any questions, please reach out to me at FallingFoodsGame@gmail.com  <br><br>

Thanks for playing Falling Foods! <br><br><br>
