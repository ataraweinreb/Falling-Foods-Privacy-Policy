  <h1>Falling Foods Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h3>Falling Foods Privacy Policy
Falling Foods uses the device's TrueDepth camera system to track the movement of your mouth. This allows for a unique user experience â€” a game you can play with your face. In order for this functionality to be possible, the app requires access to your device's camera. This access can be toggled on or off at any time in your device's settings. 

The camera images and resulting depth data are only used for gameplay purposes. The live video feed is never used, and its data is never stored locally or remotely. Camera access is required to get depth data from Apple's API's. The only depth data collected is related to the movement of your mouth: whether your mouth is in an "open", "closed" or "tongue-out" position. 

Face data is never stored remotely, given to third parties, or used for any non-gameplay purposes. The face data only remains on your device, and never leaves your device at any time. 

Additionally, the game can optionally record your screenplay with your permission and save it to the camera roll or share it via social media, email, and airdrop on select devices. 

If you have any questions, please reach out to me at FallingFoodsGame@gmail.com  

Thanks for playing Falling Foods!<h3>
